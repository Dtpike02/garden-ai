## Pesky Pests!

Finding bugs on your beloved houseplants is never fun. Here's how to identify and deal with some of the most common culprits:

### Spider Mites
* **Identification:** Tiny dots (often red or brown), fine webbing between leaves/stems, stippled yellowing leaves.
* **Treatment:** Isolate the plant. Wipe leaves thoroughly. Increase humidity. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil sprays.

### Mealybugs
* **Identification:** Small, white, cottony-looking insects often clustered in leaf axils or undersides. Produce sticky honeydew.
* **Treatment:** Dab individual bugs with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Spray with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

*(Add sections for Aphids, Fungus Gnats, etc.)*

### Prevention Tips
* Inspect new plants carefully.
* Don't overwater (especially for fungus gnats).
* Maintain good air circulation.
